Thanks to Daniel Kirsch and the team at Detexifier for their cool open-source web project that inspired me to make this app, and for providing the training data and prompt responses to my questions.

Thanks to [Will Bishop](https://twitter.com/WillRBishop) for helping me figure out a tricky problem I had with the PencilKit APIs.

Finally a big thanks to all the folks on the [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) Slack for being supportive and inspiring me to build my own iOS app.
